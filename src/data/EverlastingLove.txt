Hearts go astray, leaving hurt when they go
I went away just when you needed me so
Filled with regret I come back beggin' you
Forgive, forget. Where's the love we once knew?
Open up your eyes, then you'll realize here I stand
With my everlasting love
Need you by my side, girl you'll be my bride
You'll never be denied everlasting love
From the very start, open up your heart
Be a lasting part of everlasting love
Real love will last forever
Ooh, ooh
Where life's river flows, no one really knows
'til someone's there to show the way to lasting love
Like the sun that shines, endlessly it shine
You always will be mine. It's everlasting love
When other loves are gone, ours will still be strong
We have our very own everlasting love
Real love will last forever
You give me, you give me, you give me everlasting love
Ooh
Open up your eyes, then you'll realize here I stand
With my everlasting love
Need you by my side, girl you'll be my bride
You'll never be denied everlasting love
From the very start, open up your heart
Be a lasting part of everlasting love
Real love will last forever
Open up your eyes, then you'll realize here I stand
With my everlasting love
Need you by my side, girl you'll be my bride
You'll never be denied everlasting love
Open up your eyes, then you'll realize here I stand
With my everlasting love
Need you by my side, girl you'll be my bride
You'll never be denied everlasting love
Open up your eyes, then you'll realize here I stand
With my everlasting love
Need you by my side, girl you'll be my bride
You'll never be denied everlasting love
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh oh yeah
Mm mm mm mm
This will be
An everlasting love
This will be
The one I've waited for
This will be
The first time anyone has loved me, oh oh oh
I'm so glad
He found in time
And I'm so glad that
He rectified my mind
This will be
An everlasting love for me, whoa, ho
Loving you
Is some kind of wonderful
Because you've shown me
Just how much you care
You've given me the thrill of a lifetime
And made me believe you've got more thrills to spare, oh
This will be
And everlasting love, oh, yes, it will now
You've brought a lot of sunshine into my life
You've filled me with happiness I never knew
You gave me more joy than I ever dreamed of
And no one, no one can take the place of you
This will be you and me, yes, siree, eternally
Huggin' and squeezin' and kissin' and pleasin' together forever through
Rain or whatever
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you and me
So long as I'm livin' true love I'll be givin', to you I'll be servin'
'Cause you're so deservin'
Hey, you're so deservin'
You're so deservin', yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, love, love,
Love, love
The love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, love, love
From now on, from now on, from now on, from now on
From now on, from now on, from now on, from now on
From now on, from now on, from now on, from now on
He wasn't looking for a pretty face
She wasn't searching for the latest style
He didn't want someone who walked straight off the TV
She needed someone with an interior smile

She wasn't looking for a cuddle in the back seat
He wasn't looking for a five minute thrill
She wasn't thinking of tomorrow or of next week
This vacancy he meant to permanently fill

I need an everlasting love
I need a friend and a lover divine
An everlasting precious love
Wait for it, wait for it, give it some time

Back in the world of disposable emotion
In the climate of temporary dreams
He wasn't looking for a notch on his bedpost
A love to push, pull and burst at the seams

I need an everlasting love
I need a friend and a lover divine
An everlasting precious love
Wait for it, wait for it, give it some time

Is this love worth waiting for?
Something special, something pure

I need an everlasting love
I need a friend and a lover divine
An everlasting precious love
Wait for it, wait for it, give it some time
Wait for it, wait for it, give it some time

Is this love worth waiting for?
Bitterness will die for sure
Something special, something pure
Is this love worth waiting for?

Is this love worth waiting for?
(I need an everlasting love)
Bitterness will die for sure
Something special, something pure
(I need a friend and a lover divine)
Is this love worth waiting for?

I need an everlasting love
I need a friend and a lover divine
An everlasting precious love
Wait for it, wait for it, give it some time

I need an everlasting love
I need a friend and a lover divine
An everlasting precious love
Wait for it, wait for it, give it some time

I need an everlasting love
I need a friend and a lover divine
An everlasting precious love
Wait for it, wait for it, give it some time

I need an everlasting love
I need a friend and a lover divine
An everlasting precious love
Wait for it, wait for it, give it some time
